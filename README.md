## UNALTERED 

## Description 
It's a shooter based game taking inspiration from the Japenese festival game "Shateki". User aim the gun and shoot at items which moves from from one side to another on a stand. These items represent various deifferent countries and users have to shoot at the items to score points. There are also bombs moving along with the items, which the user should avoid as hitting/shooting these bombs will reduce the timer. If the user successfully hits an item the timer will be increased by a few seconds. The user can select one of the four regions he wants to play on on the welcome screen. The region he selects would mean that all the items on the stand will be from on the countries of the region he selected. The regions available are - Africa, South Asia, East Asia and Middle East.
